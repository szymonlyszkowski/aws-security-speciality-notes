## Data encryption within S3

* AWS KMS is being used to **encrypt** at rest (SSE server side encryption) S3 **objects**
* AWS KMS encrypts **only** the _object data_.
* Any _object metadata_ is **NOT** encrypted
* KMS keys must be **in the same region as bucket**
* S3 support only **Symmetric** keys for encryption

1. Customer managed keys (CMK) or AWS Managed keys can be used to encrypt S3 objects.
2. By default S3 uses CMK to encrypt data. If CMK does not exists it will be automatically created for encryption purposes.
3. Using CMK gives you more flexibility and control. For example, you can create, rotate, and disable customer managed keys. You can also define access controls and audit the customer managed key that you use to protect your data.


#### Bucket-level keys
SSE-KMS can:
* create **unique** data keys encrypt S3 objects.
* Such unique keys can be used for **limited time period** in order to **reduce costs** need for making requests to AWS KMS API.
