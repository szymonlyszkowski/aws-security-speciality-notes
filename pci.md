### PCI - Payment Card Industry

_A wide range of AWS services is used, including EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation, etc. Recently, internal security auditors asked you to provide a document to state that the related AWS services meet the Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. **How should you provide the document**?_

Download **PCI compliance document** from **AWS Artifact** and provide it to auditors.

_PCI DSS_ - > AWS Artifact **TODO**
